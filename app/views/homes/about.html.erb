    So, this is a thing I made! It's kind of garbage right now, but it's a work in progress. Basically, this is a version of the game designed to play over Skype and with the upmost benevolence of its players :D Here's some stuff to know about playing this:
  </p>

  <ul class="text-list">
    <li>This game does NOT track turns, it's totally up to y'all to keep track of that yourselves</li>
    <li>Anyone can click on and reveal any card at any time, so if you're not supposed to, just, you know... don't</li>
    <li>The team-making system doesn't actually do anything besides show your names in different areas of the screen, it's just for reference but doesn't actually matter!</li>
    <li>Currently, there's no way to delete a user from the system - "signing out" will remove you from the game, but sometimes extra users will just kind of accumulate. If this gets annoying, Christina can delete them from the database manually... because that's the level of polished this app is at right now, haha</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    So, what to do if you find stuff that isn't working or that you want changed?? Well, there's a handy <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m9lP9X3AdselFKLwcF_HG8CMZge3nVsVXT66h16L7A0/edit">Google dog</a> where it would be super wonderful for you to put any problems you find/thoughts you have/random shitposting/etc. <3

    Also, if you want to add words, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lP7HuOB5Qv6VEkrk8FIRbmukslYNzhbQCeVyBeh04yI/edit?usp=drive_web"> the spreadsheet is here!</a> (There will be a sick feature for this later on.)
  </p>

  <p>Love you all! :D </p>
